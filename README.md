## Custom Maps
One thing to note about using Custom Maps:

Custom Maps **MUST** be a direct downloadable link, meaning the link must immedately start the map download.

For example, https://www.dropbox.com/s/xyprhdhq5l8tmsf/procrustedit.map?dl=1 is a direct download link.

For DropBox links, ensure that the end of the link has "dl=1" and not "dl=0"
